## 📖 Background
Fatimah lives in Ghana and struggles with poverty.  
Her mother **Mavis Boakye** receives support via **MTN Mobile Money** (through WorldRemit), and passes it on to Fatimah for food and basic needs.  

Magnus has been supporting Fatimah with small transfers (50–100 SEK every 3–4 days) for more than 6 months.  
Now this site is here to invite more people to join and help.
